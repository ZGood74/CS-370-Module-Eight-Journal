# CS370 Project Two – Pirate Q-Learning Agent

This project showcases my implementation of a reinforcement learning agent, modeled as a pirate navigating a maze in search of treasure using the Q-learning algorithm. The environment was built using OpenAI Gym, where the pirate receives rewards for successful actions and penalties for inefficient or harmful choices. The agent learns optimal paths over time through exploration and reinforcement.

## What I Did
I was provided with a partially structured Jupyter Notebook containing setup code for the environment and basic function definitions. From there, I created the Q-learning training loop, defined the reward structure, implemented the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy, and added code to track and visualize the agent's learning performance over multiple training epochs. I also tuned hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon decay to improve learning stability and efficiency.

## Reflection and Connection to Computer Science
This project helped reinforce key concepts in reinforcement learning by allowing me to apply them in a practical setting. I gained a deeper understanding of how agents learn from rewards and penalties, how to balance exploration and exploitation, and how training parameters influence learning outcomes. This hands-on application deepened my understanding of trial-and-error learning systems and reward-driven decision-making.

In the broader field of computer science, reinforcement learning plays a vital role in areas such as robotics, game development, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence. Computer scientists design and implement solutions that solve real-world problems, and this type of work is essential to driving innovation in technology. Their work has meaningful impacts across industries, from improving automation to enabling smarter, more adaptive systems.

When I approach problems as a computer scientist, I focus on breaking them into manageable pieces, identifying patterns, and iteratively testing solutions. This mindset was critical in designing the pirate agent and fine-tuning its performance through careful observation and adjustment. I also learned the value of debugging and visualization tools in understanding an agent’s learning progress.

As part of this process, I reflected on the ethical responsibilities of computer scientists. In creating intelligent systems, we must consider how our algorithms affect users, organizations, and society. Systems must be designed to avoid unintended harm, remain transparent, and protect user privacy and trust. Whether building learning agents or real-world applications, ethical thinking must remain a core component of development.

## Portfolio Relevance
This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply reinforcement learning principles using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It highlights my understanding of agent-based systems, my coding ability, and my ability to analyze and fine-tune algorithms to solve problems effectively. This project is a valuable addition to my professional portfolio, showcasing both technical skill and ethical awareness.
